🚀 Career Flow
💼 A data‑driven job platform built for the CodeYourFuture community

Career Flow is a full‑stack application that centralises, organises, and surfaces job opportunities for CodeYourFuture trainees, mentors, staff.
The project is structured as a monorepo with separate backend and frontend codebases.

📖 Overview
Career Flow helps CodeYourFuture trainees discover curated roles while giving mentors and staff a simple way to manage and share opportunities.

🎯 Key goals
🎓 Reduce noise from generic job boards by focusing on roles relevant to CYF trainees

🛠️ Provide a maintainable, extensible full‑stack codebase for learning and collaboration

👥 Enable different user types (trainees, mentors, staff) to interact with the same source of truth for opportunities

✨ Features
📋 Centralised job board: Aggregated job listings stored and served by the backend and displayed via a dedicated frontend application

🔄 Deduplicated listings: The frontend includes logic to deduplicate jobs by job_id, preventing repeated postings of the same role

🏗️ Full‑stack architecture: Clear separation of concerns with Jobs-board-backend for APIs/data and Jobs-board-frontend for UI and client‑side logic

🔐 Input validation and auth‑ready: The codebase includes regex‑based login and password validation work, laying the groundwork for secure authentication flows

🤝 Collaborative workflow: Multiple contributors work via branches and pull requests, making it a realistic learning project for production‑style development

🔧 Tech Stack
Layer	Technologies
Frontend	JavaScript, React, CSS, HTML (in Jobs-board-frontend)
Backend	JavaScript (Node/Express‑style backend in Jobs-board-backend)
Repository	GitHub monorepo with separate frontend/backend folders
