🚀 Career Flow
💼 A data‑driven job platform built for the CodeYourFuture community

Career Flow is a full‑stack application that centralises, organises, and surfaces job opportunities for CodeYourFuture trainees, mentors, staff.
The project is structured as a monorepo with separate backend and frontend codebases.

📖 Overview
Career Flow helps CodeYourFuture trainees discover curated roles while giving mentors and staff a simple way to manage and share opportunities.

🎯 Key goals
🎓 Reduce noise from generic job boards by focusing on roles relevant to CYF trainees

🛠️ Provide a maintainable, extensible full‑stack codebase for learning and collaboration

👥 Enable different user types (trainees, mentors, staff) to interact with the same source of truth for opportunities

✨ Features
📋 Centralised job board: Aggregated job listings stored and served by the backend and displayed via a dedicated frontend application

🔄 Deduplicated listings: The frontend includes logic to deduplicate jobs by job_id, preventing repeated postings of the same role

🏗️ Full‑stack architecture: Clear separation of concerns with Jobs-board-backend for APIs/data and Jobs-board-frontend for UI and client‑side logic

🔐 Input validation and auth‑ready: The codebase includes regex‑based login and password validation work, laying the groundwork for secure authentication flows

🤝 Collaborative workflow: Multiple contributors work via branches and pull requests, making it a realistic learning project for production‑style development

🔧 Tech Stack

Frontend (Career flow frontend)

React	UI Framework	Component-based architecture for building interactive user interfaces with reusable components
Vite	Build Tool	Fast development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for rapid development
JavaScript (ES6+)	Programming Language	Modern JavaScript features including async/await, destructuring, and arrow functions
CSS3	Styling	Responsive design and modern layout techniques (23.1% of codebase)
HTML5	Markup	Semantic HTML structure (0.2% of codebase)

Backend (Career flow backend)

Node.js	Runtime Environment	JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine for server-side execution
Express.js	Web Framework	Minimalist web framework for building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests
PostgreSQL	Database	Relational database for persistent storage of job listings, user data, and application state
npm	Package Manager	Dependency management and script running for both frontend and backend

Development Tools

Git/GitHub	Version control and collaboration with branching strategy for feature development
VS Code	Primary IDE with extensions for JavaScript, React, and PostgreSQL
Postman	API testing and development for backend endpoints
ESLint	Code quality and style enforcement

Architecture Highlights

🗄️ Database: PostgreSQL provides robust relational data storage with ACID compliance, perfect for job listings, user accounts, and application tracking

🔌 API Design: RESTful API architecture with Express.js handling routes, middleware, and business logic

⚛️ Component Structure: React components organized for reusability and maintainability

📦 Package Management: npm manages dependencies across both frontend and backend, with separate package.json files for each

🔄 Data Flow: Backend serves data via API endpoints; frontend consumes and displays data through React components
