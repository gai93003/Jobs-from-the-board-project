Career Flow is a full‑stack application that centralises, organises, and surfaces high‑quality job opportunities for CodeYourFuture trainees, mentors, staff, and admins.

The project is structured as a monorepo with separate backend and frontend codebases.

---

## 📖 Overview

Career Flow helps CodeYourFuture trainees discover curated roles while giving mentors and staff a simple way to manage and share opportunities.

The project lives in this repo as two main folders: **`Jobs-board-backend`** (server and data layer) and **`Jobs-board-frontend`** (user interface).

### 🎯 Key goals

- 🎓 **Reduce noise** from generic job boards by focusing on roles relevant to CYF trainees
- 🛠️ **Provide a maintainable, extensible** full‑stack codebase for learning and collaboration
- 👥 **Enable different user types** (trainees, mentors, staff, admins) to interact with the same source of truth for opportunities

---

## ✨ Features

- **📋 Centralised job board**: Aggregated job listings stored and served by the backend and displayed via a dedicated frontend application

- **🔄 Deduplicated listings**: The frontend includes logic to deduplicate jobs by `job_id`, preventing repeated postings of the same role

- **🏗️ Full‑stack architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with `Jobs-board-backend` for APIs/data and `Jobs-board-frontend` for UI and client‑side logic

- **🔐 Input validation and auth‑ready**: The codebase includes regex‑based login and password validation work, laying the groundwork for secure authentication flows

- **🤝 Collaborative workflow**: Multiple contributors work via branches and pull requests, making it a realistic learning project for production‑style development

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **🗄️ Database**: PostgreSQL provides robust relational data storage with ACID compliance, perfect for job listings, user accounts, and application tracking

- **🔌 API Design**: RESTful API architecture with Express.js handling routes, middleware, and business logic

- **⚛️ Component Structure**: React components organized for reusability and maintainability

- **📦 Package Management**: npm manages dependencies across both frontend and backend, with separate `package.json` files for each

- **🔄 Data Flow**: Backend serves data via API endpoints; frontend consumes and displays data through React components
